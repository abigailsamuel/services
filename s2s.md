# Using services in another service
{: #s2s_binding}

Service access authorization provides a way for one service to access another service
directly. You can authorize and configure a service instance's access to other service instances on
the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard.

To use a service instance from another service, complete the following steps:

1. On the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard, click the tile for the service that you want to access. The dashboard for the service is displayed.
2. In the navigation pane, click **Connections** to authorize the binding from other service instances by using the console of the service instance.
3. If you want to deny other services access to the service instance, click *Connections* in the navigation pane and then click *Unbind* in the menu for the connected application to remove the service binding.
